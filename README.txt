Module easygraphcs has to be installed for animating trajectory:

    pip install easygraphics
    
The simulation is started by pressing a key.

To change configuration of the planets delete file "planets.json"
so that new one will be generated.

One unit of the distance can be compared to one milion kilometers and one unit of time is one earth day.
The simulation runs 40 days every second.


Most important variables:

isStar - sets star in the center (True or False)
target - number of target planet (indexed from 0)
startingPoint - number of planet satellite starts from (indexed from 0)
